# IdentifyingDisasterTweets

# Goals
The goal of this project is to use the training and test dataset provided by Kaggle to create a model that is able to parse tweets about a disaster from generic tweets.
1. The first metric will be accuracy, how accuratley can we parse these tweets
2. The second metric will be efficency, this project aims to build a model that actual response teams could potentially use in order to aggregate information about a disaster
3. The third metric will be understanding the tweets, such that the model may be able to identify problem and safe areas, locate missing persons and even make decisions on where to best allocate resources

# Implementation
This project will be done in Python, using Natural Language Processing.
